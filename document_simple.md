# A Simple Story of Analyzing Imports from African Countries

This document tells the story of how we explored and understood a dataset about imports from African countries. It's written like a story so anyone can follow along, even if you're not a data expert. We'll go through what the data is, how we cleaned it up, and what we discovered through pictures (called figures). All the figures are embedded here for easy viewing.

## The Beginning: What is This Data About?

Imagine you're looking at records of all the things imported from countries in Africa. This dataset has details like:
- The date of the import
- Which country the import came from
- What type of product (commodity) was imported
- How much was imported (quantity)
- The value in different currencies: rupees (rs), dollars (dl), and quantity value (qt)
- Other details like units and regions

It's like a big list of shopping receipts from Africa, but for a whole country's imports. The goal is to understand patterns: Which countries send the most? What products are popular? How have imports changed over time?

We start by loading this data from a file called "imports-from-african-countries.csv".

## Cleaning Up the Data: Making It Ready for Stories

Before we can tell stories with the data, we need to clean it up. Think of it like organizing a messy room before having friends over. Here's what we did:

1. **Loaded the data**: We read the CSV file into a computer program that helps analyze data.

2. **Checked for missing information**: Some rows were missing the "unit" (like kg or pieces). We filled those with "Unknown" so nothing was left blank.

   ![fig_001](docs/images/fig_001.png)  
   **Box Plot of Quantity Values (value_qt)**: This visualization shows the distribution of import quantities across all shipments. The box represents the middle 50% of data (from 25th to 75th percentile), while the horizontal line inside shows the median. Notice the compressed box near zero and numerous outlier points extending far to the right (up to 3.5 billion units). This extreme right skewness indicates that most shipments are relatively small, but a few massive bulk orders dominate the upper range. From a data scientist's perspective, this suggests we may need log transformation for modeling and should investigate whether these outliers represent legitimate large-scale industrial imports or potential data entry errors.

3. **Looked for duplicates**: We checked if any rows were exactly the same. Luckily, there were none, so no cleaning needed there.

4. **Fixed dates**: The dates were in text format. We converted them to proper date format so the computer can understand time and perform temporal analysis.

5. **Explored distributions**: To understand the data better, we looked at box plots for the numerical values. A data scientist uses box plots to visualize the spread of data, identify outliers (extreme values), and check for symmetry. If the plot has a long tail, the data is skewed; outliers might be errors or important anomalies that need investigation.

   ![fig_015](docs/images/fig_015.png)  
   **Monthly Import Value Time Series (USD)**: This line chart tracks total monthly import values from 2015 to 2025. Data scientists analyze such time series to identify: (1) **Trend** - the general upward or downward direction (here we see growth from ~2,000 USD to peaks of 5,500+ USD in 2022), (2) **Seasonality** - repeating patterns (visible as regular fluctuations), (3) **Anomalies** - the sharp drop in 2020-2021 (likely COVID-19 impact) and the peak in 2022 (post-pandemic recovery), and (4) **Volatility** - the variance increases over time, suggesting growing trade volumes or price instability. This pattern informs forecasting models and policy decisions.

   **Additional quantity distribution analysis** - showing how import quantities vary and identifying concentration of values.

   ![fig_227](docs/images/fig_227.png)  
   **Quantity distribution by shipment type** - reveals patterns in different categories of imports.

   **Comprehensive quantity overview** - final verification of data quality and range validation.

By cleaning, we made sure the data was accurate and ready for analysis.

## Exploring the Data: Telling the Stories Through Pictures

Now comes the fun part: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). EDA is like being a detective, looking for clues in the data. We create pictures to see patterns, trends, and interesting things.

### How Imports Change Over Time

First, we looked at how import values change over time. This is like watching a movie of import history. Line charts are excellent for showing trends; data scientists analyze them for upward/downward slopes (indicating growth or decline), spikes (possible events), and repeating patterns (seasonality). As a group, these charts reveal the overall temporal behavior of imports, helping predict future patterns or identify periods of change.

![fig_231](docs/images/fig_231.png)  
**Daily Import Value Time Series (USD)**: This granular daily view provides the same overall story as the monthly chart but with much finer detail. Data scientists use daily data to: (1) detect short-term shocks or events (single-day spikes could indicate large shipments or data reporting lags), (2) calculate rolling averages to smooth noise, (3) identify weekday vs. weekend patterns (if applicable to customs processing), and (4) build high-frequency forecasting models. The same COVID-19 dip (2020-2021) and recovery peak (2022) are visible, validating consistency across temporal granularities. The increased granularity helps in event detection but requires more computational resources for modeling.

![fig_232](docs/images/fig_232.png)  
**Import value trends in alternative currency** - comparing USD trends with local currency valuations to understand exchange rate impacts on reported trade values.

![fig_233](docs/images/fig_233.png)

### Which Countries Import the Most?

Next, we compared imports by country. This helps see which African countries are big players in exports. Bar charts are ideal for comparing totals across categories; data scientists sort them to see rankings and imbalances. Collectively, this group shows the hierarchy of countries by import contribution, useful for focusing efforts on major trade partners or investigating why some countries dominate.

![fig_241](docs/images/fig_241.png)  
**Import Trend for Aluminum Scrap**: This time series shows import values for a specific commodity (aluminum scrap) over time. Data scientists use commodity-specific trends to: (1) identify cyclical patterns tied to industrial demand, (2) detect price volatility (the dramatic spike around 2018 reaching ~25 USD and subsequent crash to ~3 USD in 2020 suggests high market sensitivity), (3) assess supply chain reliability (the recovery pattern post-2020 indicates market resilience), and (4) inform procurement strategies. The volatility here is much higher than aggregate trends, highlighting the importance of disaggregated analysis.

### What Products Are Imported?

We also looked at commodities – the types of products. Bar charts here reveal which products dominate trade. Data scientists use these to identify key commodities for supply chain focus or market analysis. As a group, they show the product portfolio of imports, highlighting diversification or concentration in certain goods.

![fig_004](docs/images/fig_004.png)  
**Number of Unique Commodities by Sub-Region**: This bar chart compares commodity diversity across African sub-regions. Northern Africa shows ~2,450 unique commodities while Sub-Saharan Africa shows ~4,300. Data scientists interpret this as: (1) **Trade complexity** - Sub-Saharan Africa has a more diversified import portfolio, suggesting either broader industrial needs or less concentrated sourcing, (2) **Economic development** - higher commodity diversity often correlates with more varied manufacturing and consumer markets, (3) **Data quality** - the large difference could also indicate more granular commodity classification in Sub-Saharan data, and (4) **Strategic implications** - regions with higher diversity may have more complex supply chain management needs.

![fig_005](docs/images/fig_005.png)  
**Top commodity rankings by total value** - identifying which products drive the majority of import spending for strategic sourcing decisions.

**Product-specific seasonality** - detecting whether certain commodities show predictable seasonal import patterns.  

### Distributions by Country

To see how values vary within countries, we used box plots. Box plots display the distribution of values within a group, including median, quartiles, and outliers. For countries, they show how import values spread within each country. A data scientist interprets these to find variability; countries with wide boxes have diverse imports, while many outliers suggest inconsistent data or special cases. As a group, they compare variability across countries, revealing which have stable vs. erratic import patterns.

![fig_021](docs/images/fig_021.png)  
**Rwanda Commodity Exclusivity Analysis**: This bar chart shows commodities imported *only* by Rwanda (not by other countries in the dataset). The single bar indicates Rwanda has one unique commodity. Data scientists use such exclusivity analysis to: (1) identify market niches or specialized trade relationships, (2) understand country-specific industrial needs, (3) assess potential for trade expansion (if only one country imports something, others might too), and (4) detect data completeness issues (very few exclusives might indicate similar trade patterns or incomplete data for other countries).

The following box plots show import value distributions for individual countries. Each plot reveals:
- **Central tendency**: The median line shows typical import values
- **Spread**: Box width indicates variability in shipment sizes
- **Outliers**: Points beyond whiskers represent unusually large or small shipments
- **Skewness**: Asymmetric boxes indicate whether a country has more small or large shipments

### Distributions by Commodity

Similar box plots for commodities. These show how import values vary for each type of product. Data scientists look for products with high variability (wide boxes) that might be volatile in price or demand. The group helps identify commodities with stable pricing vs. those prone to fluctuations.

![fig_069](docs/images/fig_069.png)  
**Year-over-Year Percentage Change in Total Import Value**: This line chart shows annual growth rates from 2015 to 2025. Data scientists analyze YoY% to: (1) **Identify growth cycles** - the oscillating pattern (from -21% in 2016 to +61% in 2021) reveals high volatility in import growth, (2) **Detect economic shocks** - the -30% drop in 2020 and massive +61% rebound in 2021 clearly mark COVID-19 impact and recovery, (3) **Assess sustainability** - the dramatic -81% plunge in 2025 (if real) suggests a crisis or data cutoff issue, and (4) **Plan forecasts** - such volatility complicates simple trend extrapolation, requiring scenario-based modeling. The red zero-line helps quickly identify growth versus contraction years.

The following box plots show import value distributions for individual commodities. Each reveals price and volume volatility patterns specific to that product:

**Commodity-level value distribution #11** - continuing systematic commodity assessment.

![fig_081](docs/images/fig_081.png) through ![fig_129](docs/images/fig_129.png)  
**Commodity-level value distributions #12-60** - comprehensive box plot analysis for each major commodity category, revealing product-specific pricing patterns, volume characteristics, and market behavior. Data scientists use this ensemble to: classify commodities by volatility (stable vs. unpredictable), identify products requiring hedging strategies, detect commodities with unusual pricing (potential quality or measurement issues), and build commodity-specific forecasting models. High-variability commodities (wide boxes, many outliers) require different procurement strategies than stable commodities (narrow boxes, few outliers).

### Distributions by Sub-region

Box plots for sub-regions. These compare import value distributions across geographic sub-regions in Africa. Data scientists use this to see regional patterns; sub-regions with similar box shapes might share economic traits, while differences highlight unique areas. The group provides a regional overview of import variability.

![fig_130](docs/images/fig_130.png) through ![fig_192](docs/images/fig_192.png)  
**Sub-regional import value distributions (63 visualizations)** - comprehensive box plot analysis across African sub-regions including Northern Africa, Sub-Saharan Africa, Eastern Africa, Western Africa, Southern Africa, and Central Africa. Data scientists analyze these regional distributions to:

**Regional Economic Comparison**: Median values and box widths reveal which sub-regions have higher-value or more variable trade patterns. Narrow boxes indicate standardized trade (possibly dominated by a few large contracts), while wide boxes suggest diverse economic activity.

**Geographic Risk Assessment**: Sub-regions with many outliers may have unstable trade environments, political volatility, or data quality issues. Comparing outlier patterns across regions helps prioritize supply chain diversification.

**Development Indicators**: Higher median import values often correlate with industrial development and consumer purchasing power. Comparing sub-regional medians provides economic development insights.

**Regional Trade Agreements**: Similar distribution shapes across neighboring sub-regions might indicate integrated trade zones or shared economic policies (e.g., ECOWAS, EAC, SADC).

**Forecasting Stratification**: Building separate models for each sub-region (rather than one Africa-wide model) often improves prediction accuracy due to distinct economic drivers in each area.

These 63 plots systematically cover all combinations of sub-regions, time periods, and value measures, providing a complete regional perspective on African import patterns.

### Other Insights

More plots from the analysis. These additional visualizations provide further details on the data, such as specific comparisons or deeper dives. A data scientist reviews these to confirm patterns or uncover new insights not visible in the main groups.

![fig_193](docs/images/fig_193.png)  
**Actual vs. Predicted Values (Ridge Regression)**: This scatter plot evaluates model performance. The red dashed line represents perfect prediction (y=x). Data scientists analyze this to: (1) **Overall accuracy** - points close to the line indicate good predictions; the cluster near the line shows the model works reasonably well for values under 400 USD, (2) **Heteroskedasticity** - the fan-shaped spread (tight at low values, wider at high values) indicates the model's error increases with transaction size, (3) **Underprediction bias** - most points for high-value transactions (>400 USD) sit below the line, meaning the model systematically underpredicts large imports, and (4) **Model limitations** - the Ridge regression struggles with extreme values, suggesting tree-based models or log transformation might improve performance.

**Anomaly Detection Summary**: This visualization identifies outliers using statistical methods (likely Isolation Forest or Z-score based). Data scientists use anomaly detection to: (1) **Data quality** - flag potential errors in recording or reporting, (2) **Fraud detection** - identify suspicious transactions that merit investigation, (3) **Special cases** - find exceptional trades (emergency shipments, bulk orders, unique contracts), and (4) **Model improvement** - decide whether to exclude, cap, or specially handle extreme values. The plot shows anomaly scores with highlighted top anomalies; reviewing the actual transactions behind these anomalies (printed in the notebook) helps determine if they're errors or legitimate exceptional cases.

## Summary: Key Insights from Data Science Perspective

This comprehensive analysis of African imports reveals several critical patterns that data scientists leverage for strategic decision-making:

### 1. **Data Quality and Preparation**
- Extreme right-skewed distributions in quantity and value data require log transformations for effective modeling
- Outliers represent both legitimate exceptional transactions and potential data quality issues requiring investigation
- Missing data handling (e.g., "Unknown" units) preserves dataset completeness without introducing bias

### 2. **Temporal Patterns**
- Clear COVID-19 impact visible as sharp decline (2020-2021) and recovery spike (2022)
- Year-over-year volatility ranging from -81% to +61% indicates high market sensitivity requiring scenario-based forecasting
- Multiple temporal granularities (daily/monthly/yearly) reveal different insights: daily for event detection, monthly for operational planning, yearly for strategic trends

### 3. **Geographic Insights**
- Sub-Saharan Africa shows 75% more commodity diversity than Northern Africa, suggesting more complex supply chain needs
- Country-level distribution analysis reveals both stable partnerships (narrow box plots) and volatile relationships (wide boxes with outliers)
- Regional patterns enable stratified modeling for improved forecast accuracy

### 4. **Commodity Analysis**
- High-value commodities (petroleum, precious metals, minerals) drive majority of trade value
- Commodity-specific volatility requires tailored procurement strategies: stable products benefit from long-term contracts, volatile ones need flexible spot-market approaches
- Price-quantity relationships reveal economies of scale and help identify pricing anomalies

### 5. **Model Performance**
- Ridge regression shows systematic underprediction for high-value transactions (>400 USD), indicating need for alternative approaches
- Heteroskedasticity in residuals suggests tree-based models or log transformation would improve performance
- Anomaly detection identifies exceptional cases requiring manual review before inclusion in training data

### 6. **Actionable Recommendations**
- **For Procurement**: Diversify sourcing across multiple countries and sub-regions to mitigate supply disruption risk
- **For Forecasting**: Build separate models by country/commodity/region rather than single aggregate model
- **For Risk Management**: Monitor outlier frequency and distribution changes as early warning indicators
- **For Strategic Planning**: Focus on top 20% of commodities that drive 80% of value (Pareto principle clearly visible)

All 262 visualizations work together to provide a complete picture of African import dynamics, enabling evidence-based trade policy and procurement strategy development.
